# Portfolio
## Description

Provide a short description:

- My motivation was to build a portfolio website, and gain experience on building websites from nothing.I needed practice in building websites from scratch and using flex boxes, and prepare for building my real portfolio website once i finish the class.It helped me understand on how flex boxes work and the challenge of building a responsive website that adjusts to any user.
